       <strong>Saturn</strong> is one of the most unique planets in our solar system. Saturn has a massive ring around it, Saturn has the <ins>biggest ring</ins> in the entire solar system. Another thing is that Saturn has such a <em>low density</em>, that if you were to put it in a massive pool it would float. Lastly, this planet is clasified as a gas giant, so it doesnt have any surface to walk on.

        Newton's thought experiment is based off of a cannon on a high mountain. Newton says that if you fire this cannon, the projectile would either hit the ground, orbit the earth, or fly out of the atmosphere. His thought experiment talks about the relationship between falling objects on earth and the Moon in orbit. Periapsis of a a space craft is when it is orbiting a planet very close to its surface, thus orbiting at a faster rate. Where Apoapsis of an aircraft is where it is orbiting further away from the surface of the planet, thus making it orbit at a slower rate.
